I have decided to spend 2017 doing a deep dive into Artifical Intelligence and Deep Learning.  This repo is a collection of all of my work, notes, resources, and projects associated with this endevour.  Additionally, I am also enrolled in the AI NanoDegree from Udacity.com.  My work associted with this program will also be posted here.

Feel free to contribute to these resouces.  I would love this to be bigger than me.
